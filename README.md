## Grading
- Programming Homework: 25%
- Quizzes 25%
- Final Project: 25%
- Final Exam: 25%

## Programming Homework
The best way to learn programming is through practice. There will be weekly programming homework. All assignments must be committed to github with a pull request by the specified deadline. You may work in pairs to complete these assignments, but if you do, make sure to have each person commit a solution to at least one problem. It is in your best interest to understand the solutions to each problem.

Assignments will be graded with the following criteria:
- Output: 50%
- Code Quality: 50%  

Note: Late submissions will receive a 10% deduction to the final grade for the assignment.
